1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

and , or , not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

True and True evaluates to True 
True and False evaluates to False 
False and True evaluates to False 
False and False evaluates to False

True or True evaluates to True 
True or False evaluates to True 
False or True evaluates to True 
False and False evaluates to False

4. What are the values of the following expressions?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)   -  False
not (5 > 4)    - False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)  - True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) - False
(True and True) and (True == False)  - False
(not False) or (not True)  - True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

==
!=
>
<
>=
<=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

We use "=" for assigning value to a variable. for example  a = 10
We use == for comparing two values or variables. for example  if (a==b).

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0

first bloack :
if spam == 10:
print("eggs")

second block :
if spam > 5:
print("bacon")

third block :
else:
print("ham")
print("spam")
print("spam")

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = input()
if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

CTRL+C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

When break is used, program comes out of the current loop
When continue is used, program skips the next code and goes to next iteration in the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

There is no difference. All the three statements work same way.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(0,10,1) :
    print(i+1)

a = 1
while(a<=10):
    print(a)
    a=a+1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

import spam as sp
sp.bacon()
